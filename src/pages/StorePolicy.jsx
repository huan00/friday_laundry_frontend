        <p>
          I’m a Customer Care section. I’m a great place to write a long text
          about your company and your services, and, most importantly, how to
          contact your store with queries. Writing a detailed Customer Care
          policy is a great way to build trust and reassure your customers that
          they can buy with confidence.

            verify payment, the way you collect data or when will you contact
            users after their purchase was completed successfully.
